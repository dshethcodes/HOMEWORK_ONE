# HOMEWORK_ONE
For this assignment, I made the initial mistake of not having git set up to my school email, and it was instead linked to my personal account. 
That is why there are six commits (7, if you include this README page) instead of three commits, as I had already completed all three commits by the time it was announced that we needed to use our school email.
